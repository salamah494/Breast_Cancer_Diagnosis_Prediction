# Breast_Cancer_Diagnosis_Prediction
This project is about a breast cancer dataset which has about 569 features(columns) and 32 samples(rows) with our main target as the diagnosis feature(.The main aim of this project is to use a good predictive machine learning model to predict whether the diagnosis feature is benign or malignant(i.e whether  a tumor is cancerous or non-cancerous).

Project Goals
- Understand the structure of the breast cancer dataset
- Use data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Perform visual exploratory analysis to identify key patterns
- Prepare the dataset for future machine learning model
Objective
The objective of this project is to answer t-he question: "What features are most indicative of malignant or benign breast cancer tumors?" By analyzing the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, we aim to develop a reliable model for breast cancer diagnosis.
Methodology

We'll utilize the Logistic Regression algorithm from the Scikit-learn library to create a predictive model. This project will be structured into four sections, covering data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
