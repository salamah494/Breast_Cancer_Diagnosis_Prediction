# Breast_Cancer_Diagnosis_Prediction
This project is about a breast cancer dataset which has about 569 features(columns) and 32 samples(rows) with our main target as the diagnosis feature(.The main aim of this project is to use a good predictive machine learning model to predict whether the diagnosis feature is benign or malignant(i.e whether  a tumor is cancerous or non-cancerous).

Project Goals
- Understand the structure of the breast cancer dataset
- Use data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Perform visual exploratory analysis to identify key patterns
- Prepare the dataset for future machine learning model

• Objective
The objective of this project is to answer t-he question: "What features are most indicative of malignant or benign breast cancer tumors?" By analyzing the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, we aim to develop a reliable model for breast cancer diagnosis.

• Methodology
We'll utilize the Logistic Regression algorithm from the Scikit-learn library to create a predictive model. This project will be structured into four sections, covering data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
In this project, we successfully built a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

After conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identifying key patterns, we applied feature scaling and we also removed highly correlated features such as concavity_mean,perimeter_worst, and area_mean to avoid redundancy and improve model generalization.

We trained a Logistic Regression Model, which achieved a high accuracy of 95% on the test data.
